      Fides, Latin for “faith, trust, loyalty,” are key concepts for the young Quartet at the beginning of their chamber music training and professional careers. It is the belief that it is worthwhile to walk a path together, and the trust that its value is preserved and fulfilled only through the act of walking it. Since its founding in 2022, the Quartet has been studying with great success in the chamber music class of Professor Alexander Pavlovsky, first violinist of the internationally acclaimed Jerusalem Quartet.
